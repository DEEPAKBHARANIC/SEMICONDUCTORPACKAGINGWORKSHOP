	           Module 1.2 understanding package requirements and foundational package types : The package requirement selecting the right semiconductor package is a crucial step as it affects the performance cost thermal management size and reliability,
	          The criteria for semiconductor package selection generally fall into the following key categories:
	                          • Application-specific Requirements
					> Logic/ Memory die
					> Power semiconductor die)
				• Electrical Requirements
					> I/O Pin Count
					> Signal Integrity for high speed I/Os
					> Power Delivery
				• Thermal Requirements
					> Thermal Dissipation
					> Operating Temperature Range
				• Mechanical and Physical constraints
					> Form Factor: Footprint and chip height requirements for the system
					> System Integration needs: MCM, SiP, 2.5/3D packaging for tighter integration
				• Cost Considerations
					> Package cost
					> Board/ System Assembly cost
				• Reliability and Durability
					> Mechanical stress
					> Thermal cycling
					> Moisture and other environmental factors
     >>> IC package consist of 1, dye 2, carrier substrate 3, dye to carrier interconnections 4, carrier to board interconnections 5, mould compound.
     >>> Mounting technologies: 
     Through hole mounting 1,  TO : transistor outline 2,  sip : single inline package 3,  dip : dual inline package 4, PGA : pin grid array  
     	• Surface Mount Technology:
		> (T)SOT : (Thin) Small Outline Transistor
		> (T)SOP : (Thin) Small Outline Package
		> SOIC : Small Outline IC Package
		> QFN : Quad Flat No-leads
		> QFP : Quad Flat Package
		> PBGA : Plastic Ball Grid Array
		> LGA : Land Grid Array
		> FCBGA : Flip Chip Ball Grid Array
		> CSP : Chip Scale Package
	• Advanced Packages
		> PoP : Package on Package (Qualcomm SD series, Apple A-Series, Samsung Exynos etc.)
		> MCM : Multi-Chip Module (eg: Intel Broadwell)
		> SiP : System-in-Package (Apple S1)
		> CoWoS : Chip on Wafer on Substrate (eg: Nvidia GP100, GV100, GA100, etc.)
                   MODULE 1.3 : classification and antomy of semiconductor packages : 
		   In Convnetional packaging the wafer is sawed into dice before the chip is packaged, while wafer-level packaging involves a part, or all, of the packaging process being performed at the wafer level before proceeding with wafer sawing.
	Conventional Packages : 
                        PLASTIC >>Leadframe Type and substarte type
                        CERAMIC 
	Wafer-Level Packages
                        Wafer-Level Chip Scale Packages (WLCSP) 1, Fan-out WLCSP 1, Fan-in WLCSP
                        Redistribution Layer (RDL) 
                        Flip Chip 
                        Through-Silicon Via (TSV) 

        MODULE 1.3 
	           Depending on the medium of the package, packages can be further categorized into leadframe and laminate packages.
	• Leadframe-Based Packages
		> DIP: Traditional, with wirebonds and external leads
		> QFN: Compact with exposed thermal pads
		> Leadframe CSP & QFP: Scaled for density and SMT
	• Laminate-Based Packages
		> PBGA: Wirebonded to laminated substrates
		> Flip Chip PBGA: Superior signal and thermal performance
		> LGA, FCCSP: Common in modern devices
	• Advanced Substrates
		> 2D: Dies placed side-by-side on the same substrate
		> 2.1D: Adds RDL for better routing
		> 2.3D: Uses organic interposers
		> 2.5D: Silicon interposer for high-speed interconnects (e.g.: CoWoS)
	MODULE 1.4 
		1.4.1 - Redistribution Layers (RDL)
		RDL (Redistribution Layer) is a metal layer added on top of a die or wafer to reroute the I/O pads to new locations. This enables more flexible bump layouts, especially important for fan-out packages or wafer-level chip scale packaging (WLCSP).
			• Applications
				> Fan-out wafer-level packaging (FO-WLP, FO-BGA)
				> Panel-level packaging (PLP)
				> Multi-die integration
				> System-in-Package (SiP)
			• Advantages:
				> Allows larger bump pitch for finer pad layouts
				> Reduces package size and thickness
				> Enables multi-chip placement and interconnect on a single substrate
		1.4.2 - Interposers
		An interposer is a passive or active layer inserted between the die and the substrate, acting as an intermediate routing interface. It enables dense signal routing, power delivery, and die-to-die interconnect.
			• Types: Silicon, Organic, Glass
			• Functions: - Routes signals between multiple dies (e.g., chiplets) - Provides thermal expansion management - Enables high bandwidth communication
			• Passive vs. Active Interposers:
				> Passive: No logic, just routing and vias
				> Active: Includes power delivery, clocking, or even memory logic
		1.4.3 - 2.5D/3D Integration
			• 2.5D: Multiple dies (e.g., CPU + HBM) placed side-by-side on a common interposer. Interposer provides connectivity, not the substrate directly. Popular in HPC and AI (e.g., AMD Instinct, NVIDIA GPUs with HBM).
		3D: Dies are stacked vertically, interconnected through Through-Silicon Vias (TSVs). 3D NAND, HBM memory stacks, logic-on-logic stacking.
