	   >>  Semiconductor packaging helps the finished semiconductor dye in a foundry cleanroom into the real world Which will be used to integrate in the SOC. Key functions of a packages are protection from external environment and electrical connection between the dye and the external environment via leads and mechanical support and connection to the die, thermal dissipation to conduct the heat away from the dye. Semiconductor manufacturing process consist of front end and back end process. In front end wafer manufacturing typically we design and wafer process, In back end package & testing and assemble will come. You can divide them into three flows one is wafer testing second one is package and third one is package testing.
	           # ---1.2 understanding package requirements and foundational package types : The package requirement selecting the right semiconductor package is a crucial step as it affects the performance cost thermal management size and reliability,

	 #-----1.4 
			1.4.1 - Redistribution Layers (RDL)
			RDL (Redistribution Layer) is a metal layer added on top of a die or wafer to reroute the I/O pads to new locations. 
	  This enables more flexible bump layouts, especially important for fan-out packages or wafer-level chip scale packaging (WLCSP).
				• Applications
					> Fan-out wafer-level packaging (FO-WLP, FO-BGA)
					> Panel-level packaging (PLP)
					> Multi-die integration
					> System-in-Package (SiP)
				• Advantages:
					> Allows larger bump pitch for finer pad layouts
					> Reduces package size and thickness
					> Enables multi-chip placement and interconnect on a single substrate
			#1.4.2 - Interposers
			An interposer is a passive or active layer inserted between the die and the substrate, acting as an intermediate routing interface.
	  It enables dense signal routing, power delivery, and die-to-die interconnect.
				>> Types: Silicon, Organic, Glass
				>> Functions: - Routes signals between multiple dies (e.g., chiplets) - Provides thermal expansion management - 
	Enables high bandwidth communication
				>> Passive vs. Active Interposers:
					> Passive: No logic, just routing and via				
	                                > Active: Includes power delivery, clocking, or even memory logic
			#1.4.3 - 2.5D/3D Integration
				2.5D: Multiple dies (e.g., CPU + HBM) placed side-by-side on a common interposer. Interposer provides connectivity, not the substrate directly. Popular in HPC and AI (e.g., AMD Instinct, NVIDIA GPUs with HBM).
			        3D: Dies are stacked vertically, interconnected through Through-Silicon Vias (TSVs). 3D NAND, HBM memory stacks, logic-on-logic stacking.

# ---MODULE 2 : PACKAGE MANUFACTURING
       2.1 --- Review of the supply chain : 
  				1, Design house.
      				2, wafer fabrication.
	  			3, Package assembly and test.
      				4, Board Assembly and test.
	  			5, Product Assembly and test.
      2.1.1 --- Introduction to a Package Manufacturing Unit (ATMP)
               The ATMP process involves four core activities: Assembly, Testing, Marking, and Packaging. 
	       The ATMPs could be OSATs (like ASE, Amkor, TATA etc.) or in-house ATMPs of IDMs (like Intel, Samsung, Micron) or Foundries (like TSMC, Samsung Foundry).
		      >> layout representation of ATMP 
	                        1. Material Preparation and Storage - Incoming Wafers, Substrates, Leadframes, Mold Compounds, Consumables
				2. Processing Zone (Clean Room: ISO Class 6 & 7) - Major activities:
					> Die Attach & Mount
					> Wire or Flip-Chip Bonding
					> RDL formation
					> Encapsulation/ molding.
				3. Testing Area - Electrical Tests - Burn-in Test - Reliability chamber testing.
                                4. Warehouse - Storage of packaged ICs.

     2.2 --- WAFER PRE_PREPARATION : the wafer preparation process inside an ISO Class 7 cleanroom of an ATMP facility.
		        1. Incoming Wafer Carrier: Wafers arrive in a protective carrier that ensures they remain uncontaminated before entering the processing line.
			2. Wafer Inspection: The wafers are visually and optically inspected for surface defects, contamination, or damage before further processing.
			3. Wafer Front Tape Lamination: A protective tape is laminated on the front (device side) of the wafer to protect it during subsequent processes like grinding and dicing.
			4. Wafer Backside Grinding: The wafer’s backside is ground using a rotating grinding wheel to reduce the wafer thickness from the ~700um to around 200um and enable better thermal performance and flexibility for final packaging.
			5. Tape Frame Mounting to Wafer Backside: After grinding, the wafer is mounted on a ring frame using an adhesive tape. This stabilizes the wafer and keeps individual die in place during dicing.
			6. Two-step Wafer Dicing (Laser Grooving + Blade Dicing):
		                      6.1 Laser Grooving: Precision laser cuts grooves along scribe lines to weaken the wafer structure.
		                      6.2 Blade Dicing: A high-precision blade is then used to physically dice the wafer into individual dies or chips.

	2.3 : Wire Bond Packaging - Die Attach To Molding.
	                                wafer is diced and checked and picked the best DIE from the wafer accordingly and put on the substarte.  
	    		1. Die Attach: The individual (die) is attached to a substrate or lead frame using epoxy.
				1.1 The Epoxy is dispensed onto the die in some pattern so as to avoid any voids during attach. (Pattern complexity vs. speed of processing trade-off)
				1.2 The die is picked up by the pick-up head, and
				1.3 Placed on the Die Attach Film (DAF)
	    video : https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=die+attach+overview+animation
		2. Curing: The die-attached unit is subjected to a heating process to cure the epoxy, ensuring a strong and stable bond between the die and the substrate.
		3. Wire Bonding: Fine gold or aluminum wires are bonded between the die and the package substrate pads using thermal and ultrasonic energy.
				3.1 Formation of a ball bond using an EFO (Electronic Flame-Off) spark 
	   			3.2 Bonding the ball to the die pad (using pressure, vibration, heat) 
	      			3.3 Creating a wire loop 3.4 Forming a crescent bond on the substrate side
		   YOUTUBE video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YkGrhvrWxA
		4. Molding (Transfer Molding): A mold compound is injected to encapsulate the wire-bonded die, providing protection from environmental damage and mechanical stress. Resin flows uniformly to cover the entire chip.
		5. Marking (Laser): Laser marking is used to engrave identification codes, logos, or batch numbers on the molded package surface.
		6. Singulation (Dicing Blade): The molded wafer is cut into individual units (ICs) using a dicing blade. A thinner blade is typically used to minimize chipping and maximize precision.
	 2.4   - Flip Chip Assembly - Bump Formation And Underfill 
	 Flip chip packaging enhances electrical performance and I/O density by mounting the die face-down on the substrate.
	 	1. Bump Formation on Silicon (Si): 
	    				1.1 Solder bumps are created on the die.
					1.2 The bumps are then reflowed to form strong electrical and mechanical connections.
		2. Chip Flip and Placement:
	 				2.1 The chip is flipped upside down.
					2.2 Flux is dispensed on to the substrate to aid solder wetting.
					2.3 Solder balls are aligned with the substrate’s bond pads.
		3. Solder Reflow: The chip is heated so that the solder balls melt and bond with the substrate.
		4. Flux Cleansing: The excess residual flux is removed using solvent spray to prevent corrosion.
		5. Underfill Dispensing: Underfill material is applied to improve mechanical strength and thermal conductivity between the die and substrate.
		6. Underfill Cure: Heated to cure the underfill.
		7. Molding: A protective mold compound is applied.
		8. Marking: Laser marking is done for identification (part number, lot, batch, date of manufacture etc.) and traceability.
		9. Ball Mounting and Reflow: Solder balls are mounted on the substrate. A final reflow process ensures firm attachment of solder balls
	2.5 - Wafer Level Packaging And Conclusion
			Wafer-Level Packaging (WLP) is a technique where the entire packaging process is done at the wafer level, before dicing and offers smaller size, and lower cost.
			There are two main types of WLP:
				• Fan-in WLP (FI-WLP) : I/O pads are redistributed within the die area to match the solder bumps.
				• Fan-out WLP (FO-WLP) : Uses RDLs to extend the I/O pads beyond the die area, enabling higher I/O density.
		FO-WLP Process
				1. Reconstitution Process: 1.1 Diced Wafer is taken
						1.2 From this, only the known-good dies are picked and placed onto a temporary carrier.
						1.3 Molding to form a single reconstituted wafer after releasing the carrier.
				2. RDL (Redistribution Layer) Preparation: 
						    2.1 Dielectric & Metal are layers are deposited on to the reconstituted wafer and patterned.
						    2.2 Multiple such RDL layers are patterned to form the final RDL, similar to the metallization stages in FEOL/ CMOS facbrication
				3. Solder Ball Attach: Solder Balls are mounted on the final RDL pads to enable surface mounting.
	Final Laser Marking and Singulation: Each packaged die is marked and the reconstituted wafer is diced (singulated) into individual packages.
